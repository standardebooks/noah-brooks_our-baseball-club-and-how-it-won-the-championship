			<p class="center">MIKE COSTIGAN’S DISCOVERY.</p>
			<p class="drop">M<span class="uppercase">eantime</span>, strange things had happened in Catalpa. The town was in a ferment on the morning of the great day when the Catalpa nine were to play their second game with the Calumets. The glory of the first day’s victory shone brightly to encourage the friends of the club as they loitered towards the telegraph office and clustered under the windows of the office of <i>The Leaf</i>, when the time for calling the game drew near.</p>
			<p>In the office of that influential sheet there was much commotion, as every printer at the case and every member of the slender editorial staff, even down to the young lady who wrote fashion articles out of the Chicago newspapers, was in some way interested in base ball. Those who were not members of a nine were in training, or were represented by men who were active players. Therefore, while the expectant crowd in the street below was hungry for news from the Diamond Field, the smaller convocation in the printing office above was even hungrier for the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> to hang out the banner of victory which all were sure would wave from the roof of <i>The Leaf</i> before the day was done.</p>
			<p>A few despatches, vague and dealing only in glittering generalities, as the editor said, were sent early by Albert Heaton and were duly bulletined by “The Leaflet,” as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Downey’s office boy was generally called. There were many inquiries at the telegraph office for news, but “the lady operator,” with needless asperity, referred all applicants to the editor of <i>The Leaf</i>.</p>
			<p>Mike Costigan, the telegraph messenger, and Hank Jackson, the ex-champion of the Dean County Nine, were the greatest trials which the long-suffering lady at the telegraph desk had to endure. Mike had put his whole soul, which was large for his small body, into the base ball championship, and he was ready to weep if the Catalpas should not return with what he called “the skelps of them Chicago fellers” at their belts. As for Hank, he pretended to be in momentary expectation of a telegraphic despatch. As early as nine o’ clock in the morning, he had begun to haunt the telegraph office and demand a message that did not come. Mike was sure that Jackson would have early news from the seat of war, and, wisely fearing Hank’s heavy hand and rough tongue, he followed him at a respectful distance, waiting to hear something to encourage his fond hopes of the Catalpa club.</p>
			<p>The lad had been hurrying out with a message to Heaton’s flouring mills, and he bounced up the stairs of the telegraph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> office, three at a time, and flew into the room where the hard-worked operator was rattling at the instrument. A swift look from Mike took in the whole situation. Henry Jackson was seated on a bench in a corner of the office, with his back to the door, puzzling over a little book and a telegraphic despatch. He inspected the pages of the book, then scanned the message, and then, licking the end of a lead-pencil, wrote something on the paper containing the despatch.</p>
			<p>“Here, hurry with this message, Mike,” said the lady in the office, “and be quick about it; you are always loitering about the corner when you are wanted.”</p>
			<p>Almost wild at being sent out before he could get an opportunity to extract a bit of news from Hank Jackson, Mike flew out on his errand, astonished the receiver of the message by telling him to hurry up with his signature, and then went back to the office on the wings of the wind. Alas! when Mike re-entered the room, breathless and hot, Hank had departed without leaving any trace of the quality of the news that he might have received. No, not quite so bad as that, thought Mike, as he ruefully surveyed the empty bench, for there in a corner, tossed under the bench on which Henry had been sitting, was a wad of crumpled paper which the boy’s experienced eyes told him was from the telegraph company’s stores of stationery.</p>
			<p>Pouncing upon the ragged ball with the hunger of a small boy in pursuit of information concerning a base ball match, Mike drew forth a “receiving blank,” torn and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> crumpled, on which was written an incomprehensible message. Kneeling on the floor, his stubby hands shaking with excitement, Mike smoothed out the torn despatch, joining the two larger fragments so as to get the meaning of the words. And this, after some botheration, was what was revealed to Mike’s distended eyes:⁠—</p>

			<p>“Gosh all hemlock!” this was Mike’s extreme of profanity, “if Ben Burton hasn’t gone and sold the game!” The lad, who was shrewd beyond his years, carefully put the pieces of paper inside of his jacket, buttoned it up tightly, and, after ascertaining that no message was coming over the wires, and that he might decamp without fear, bolted out of the office, threw himself downstairs, and darted into <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Selby’s shop like a shot.</p>

			</p>
			<p>“Here! here! Tom,” he gasped, almost beside himself with anxiety and alarm. “Ben Burton’s goin’ to sell the game! Leastways, here’s somethin’ crooked! Look at it!”</p>
			<p>Thomas, who was keeping shop while his father was absent for a moment, took the paper, with a puzzled look at Mike, then spreading it out on the counter, scrutinized it carefully, and, as he felt a cold chill running down his back at the revelation of an unsuspected rascality, he smote the walnut plank of the counter and cried, “By ginger!” This was Tom’s extreme of profanity.</p>
			<p>“Where did you get this?” he demanded of the excited Mike.</p>
			<p>“In the office, under the bench there by the stove, where Hank throwed it. I seen him readin’ it, and then lookin’ into a little book⁠—one of them books that has the meanin’ of words into ’em.”</p>
			<p>“Dictionary?” suggested Tom.</p>
			<p>“Yes, dictionary, that’s what it is. And he’d get a word outen that, then put it down. I had to get out on a message to ’Squire Dewey, and when I got back he was gone; but I got the message. Don’t you think it’s crooked?”</p>
			<p>“Of course I do; and be sure you don’t let on to a living soul what you have seen. We’ll circumvent him yet.”</p>
			<p>Mike rushed back to his post, sober with a sense of the important secret that he carried under his ragged jacket.</p>
			<p>As soon as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Selby returned, Tom laid the matter before him. The old gentleman was astounded and grieved. No time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> was to be lost. Tom must hasten to the telegraph office and send a warning message to Captain Hiram Porter. The lad hurried away, stopping on the sidewalk below the office long enough to note Hank Jackson offering “two to one,” as he phrased it, against the Catalpas. The despatch was sent and Tom sauntered back, half-tempted to take up one of the offers of the presumptuous and boastful Hank; but he refrained. He knew that the game of the conspirators had been circumvented. It would be his day’s delight to stand by and see the dishonest scheme recoil upon the heads of its promoters.</p>
			<p>But as the day wore on and despatches from the ball ground (at first favorable and conclusive proof to the Selbys that they had nipped the conspiracy in the bud) grew more and more discouraging, Tom became desperate; he longed for wings that he might fly to Chicago and reveal the depth of infamy into which one of the club had fallen. Later in the day, when defeat seemed certain, yielding to the boy’s importunities, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Selby sent a message to Albert Heaton, in care of Judge Morris.</p>
			<p>“Where did you send Hiram’s despatch to?” he asked of Tom, suddenly, as if a new suspicion crossed his mind.</p>
			<p>“To the Lavalette House, of course. They all stop there!”</p>
			<p>“Oh, you idiot!” groaned his father. “They had gone to the ball ground before your despatch could reach Chicago!”</p>
